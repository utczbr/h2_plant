# OPEX Configuration
# Based on "CAPEX e OPEX - Cópia de OPEX.pdf" methodology
# 
# Strategies:
#   - variable: Price × Quantity (from simulation)
#   - fixed: Manual fixed annual cost
#   - factor: % of base value (FCI, Labor)
#   - turton_labor: Turton formula for operator estimation
#   - scaling: Production-scaled costs
